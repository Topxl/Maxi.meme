# 🤟 Welcome to Maxi.meme

## Maxi.meme 🚀

At Maxi.meme, we believe in fair crypto where everyone buys at the same price—no manipulation. Thanks to our transparent reverse auctions (1 hour, 1 billion fixed tokens) and a public map of holders linked to their X account, we empower the community by eliminating opacity and toxic speculation.

### 🌟 Our Vision

Crypto deserves better than fleeting traps and empty promises.

At Maxi.meme, we are building an ecosystem where **trust replaces greed** and every voice counts as much as a wallet address.

We reject deceitful games: no hidden privileges, no “pump and dump”—just clear, immutable rules designed to protect those who still believe in the original spirit of blockchain: **fairness above all**.

### ⚙️ How It Works

*   **🛡️ A Radically Transparent Dutch Auction**

    Each new token is launched at $1, then its price decreases linearly over 1 hour. The final accepted price becomes the uniform price for everyone.
*   **🎯 All or Nothing**

    If the 1 billion tokens are not sold within 1 hour, the auction is canceled and funds are returned. No undervalued project, no sacrificed community.
*   **🔍 Your X Accounts, Guardians of Transparency**

    By linking your X profile to your address, you show the world who you are and what you hold. Our “bubble map” displays, in real time, the holders, their shares, and their faces. No more complicit anonymity—just a responsible community proud of its choices.

### 🚀 Why It’s Revolutionary

Because we replace darkness with light.

A token launched at Maxi.meme cannot be dumped by insiders: if you buy, you pay the same price as your neighbor.

Seeing the faces of holders reminds us that **every decision impacts humans, not just wallets**.
