# ðŸš€ Gradual Launch

### What is it?

Each token launch on MaxiMeme uses a **gradual price reduction mechanism** instead of a classic auction.

#### How it works

* The launch starts at **$1 per token**.
* The price **decreases over time** until the full supply is purchased.
* The **final price**, paid by the last buyer, becomes the price for **all buyers**.
* Users can **sell** their tokens anytime during or after the launch.

#### Duration

* Each launch lasts **1 hour** maximum.
* The launch ends early if **100% of the supply is sold**.

#### Benefits

* Fair and transparent pricing
* Every buyer pays the **same final price**
* Encourages early discovery and engagement

#### What happens after?

* The token gets listed with a **Raydium swap** for post-launch trading.
* Part of the raised SOL is **locked as liquidity**.
* The remaining portion is allocated to **treasury, creators, or distributed per the tokenomics**.
