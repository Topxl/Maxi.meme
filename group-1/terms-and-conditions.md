# üìé Terms and Conditions

### 1. How it works <a href="#id-1.-how-it-works" id="id-1.-how-it-works"></a>

MaxiMeme is the best place to discover (and launch) the next trending token (‚ÄúCollection‚Äù). All Collection creations are fair ‚Äì meaning, there is no pre-sale, no insiders, and no scammy dynamics. All Collections have a fixed one (1) billion supply.

Each token is created by you when you initiate the creation of a smart-contract on the selected public blockchain. Once you create the token, the code becomes self-perpetuating and cannot be changed by you, or anyone else. These smart contracts are fully audited by Ackee Blockchain \[https://ackee.xyz]. Further, the supply and trading dynamics of any token on MaxiMeme follow fixed transfer and exchange rules set by the blockchain protocol that applies to every creator and all tokens and cannot be arbitrarily changed to prevent individuals from selling their tokens. But beware ‚Äì prices could collapse anyway! That is the nature of meme tokens, and you willingly accept all risks in participating. _**You promise not to hold MaxiMeme**_ _**responsible for any money you may spend and lose on tokens.**_

If MaxiMeme detects or suspects that you are using the software interface for fraudulent purposes or in violation of any law, in a way that violates these Terms and Conditions, MaxiMeme reserves the right to change information related to your token or remove public access to the token, at any time, at the sole discretion of the Interface Providers (defined below).

### 2. Who is Behind MaxiMeme <a href="#id-2.-who-is-behind-moonshot" id="id-2.-who-is-behind-moonshot"></a>

Firstly and most importantly, you are. MaxiMeme is a software interface that allows users to access token creation and wallet features native to certain public blockchain protocols.

Blockchain technologies carry a relatively high amount of foreseeable and unforeseeable risk from security, financial, technical, political, social, and personal safety standpoints. You understand that crypto-assets, including tokens, may have no present or future value and are highly volatile in nature due to many diverse factors, including without limitation use and adoption, speculation, manipulation, technology, security, and legal and regulatory developments and application. Furthermore, the speed and cost of transacting with cryptographic technologies, such as blockchains, are variable and highly volatile. You understand that the transparent nature of many blockchains means that any interactions you have with a blockchain may be publicly visible and readable in human form.

You represent that you are familiar with the underlying blockchain technologies behind the tokens, and the risks of buying them, which include but are not limited to vulnerability to hacking and total loss of your funds.
